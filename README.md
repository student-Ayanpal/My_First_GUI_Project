# 🧠 Mini Project: Remove a Word from a Sentence ✂️📝

This is a simple Python GUI application built using **Tkinter**. The app allows users to input a sentence and remove a specific word from it. The cleaned sentence is then displayed as the output.

---

## 🚀 Project Goal

I created this project as a beginner-level practice exercise while learning **Python GUI development**. The goal is to strengthen my understanding of:

- ✅ Tkinter `Text` widget and event handling
- ✅ User input validation
- ✅ Message boxes and warnings
- ✅ Basic string manipulation

---

## 🛠 Features

- 🔸 Enter any sentence.
- 🔸 Enter a single word to be removed.
- 🔸 If the word exists, it is removed and the new sentence is shown.
- 🔸 Input validation ensures:
  - Empty fields are not allowed
  - Only one word can be entered for removal
  - The word must exist in the sentence

---

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Input Sentence**: The user types a sentence in the first box.
2. **Input Word**: The user types a single word (that must be present in the sentence).
3. **Output**: The app shows the sentence with that word removed.

## 🧰 Requirements

No external packages are needed. Tkinter comes built-in with Python.

Just run:

```bash
python main.py
🙌 Why I Made This
This is part of my journey to learn how to build complete applications using only Python and its built-in libraries. I wanted to practice:

GUI design using Tkinter

Input/output handling

Applying logic with string operations

✅ Next Steps
In future versions, I plan to:

Add support for case-insensitive word removal

Highlight removed words

Add undo/redo options

🤝 Acknowledgment
Thanks to the Python community for making GUI programming fun and accessible for beginners!
